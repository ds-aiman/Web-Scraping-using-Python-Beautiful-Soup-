**Web Scraping using Python (Beautiful Soup)**

**Web scraping is a term used to describe the use of a program or algorithm to extract and process large amounts of data from the web.**

Let's say you find data from the web, and there is no direct way to download it, web scraping using Python is a skill you can use to extract the data into a useful form that can be imported.

**Beautiful Soup** is a Python library used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It provides Pythonic idioms for **iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree,** which is useful for extracting information from web pages.

**What are we going to do in this session-**
- Data extraction from the web using Python's Beautiful Soup module
- Data manipulation and cleaning using Python's Pandas library
- Data visualization using Python's Matplotlib library
The dataset we will use is taken from a 10K race that took place in Hillsboro, OR on June 2017.

Specifically, you will analyze the performance of the 10K runners and answer questions such as:

- **Question 1** What was the average finish time for the runners?
- **Question 2** Did the runners finish time follow a normal distribution?
- **Question 3** Were there any performance differences between males and females?

Using Jupyter Notebook, we should start by importing the necessary modules (pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn).
